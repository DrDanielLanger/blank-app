# Description

This program is intended to compare an IP document e.g. third-party patent with the database of internal ThermoFisher Scientific technical know-how like patents, invention disclosures, design concept studies.
Therefore, any technical document (e.g. patent, technical description) can be uploaded here and will be compared using the **AskOurDocs** function of Gene.AI.

1. Upload the file to compare by drag and drop in the Input box or browse your folders.
2. Press compare to let Gene.AI analyze the document
3. Get the result in the Output box

#### The current version displays the front end only. The functionality using AskOurDocs is not implemented yet. The comparison button just writes a generic sentence. The final version will cover a specific prompt, especially created to analyze the technical content of the uploaded document and compare this with the technical content of a bunch of other documents. In order to respect the token limit of AI the main content will be written into a csv file for compression and reduction of words. ####
